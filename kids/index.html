                        <p><b>Cost?</b> Pricing varies based on location, topics, and the number of students. Rates start at $15/hr for nearby lessons; I want coding to be accessible! Contact me for details.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Coding is a valuable skill that opens up countless career opportunities. Starting young gives kids a major advantage, setting them up for high-paying, in-demand careers.</p>
                        <p>I specialize in making coding accessible and fun. If your child starts learning between the ages of 8-13, they could be a senior developer by the time they turn 18! The demand for experienced developers, especially in C# and .NET, is growingâ€”particularly in the Knoxville area.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Absolutely! There are many great free resources out there. However, many kids struggle to stay motivated or don't know where to begin. They often get frustrated when things don't work as expected, and that discouragement can lead them to quit.</p>
                        <p>My classes provide structure, guidance, and hands-on help to keep kids engaged and progressing. I make sure they don't get stuck on small issues, helping them build confidence and problem-solving skills.</p>

                        <p>While coding schools can be beneficial, my teaching style is more personalized. I focus on tutoring-style lessons tailored to each student's level and interests, helping them build on what they already know.</p>
                        <p>Parents and students who were initially unsure have become regulars because they see real progress. Plus, my classes are more affordable than traditional coding schools since I don't have the overhead costs of a large institution.</p>

            <h2>About Lessons</h2>
            <p>I'm using the project-based approach to help kids see their programming results right away and stay interested. My theory is that if projects contain a subject that the kid enjoys, then it'll be easier for them to continue being interested in learning more.</p>

            <p>If they're new to coding, we'll start with Scratch so they can have fun while learning the basics. If they've already dabbled in Scratch, we'll dive into Python and JavaScript to start building real-world projects. And if they already know a programming language and have a cool idea they want to bring to life, I'd love to help make it happen!</p>

            <h3>Scratch</h3>
            <p>A beginner-friendly, drag-and-drop language that makes it easy for kids to see their results instantly. Great for building games and animations.</p>
            <h3>Python</h3>
            <p>An easy-to-read programming language, perfect as an introduction to text-based coding.</p>
            <h3>JavaScript</h3>
            <p>Runs directly in the browser, helping students learn how to make interactive web pages.</p>
            <h3>C#/.NET in Godot Engine</h3>
            <p>A beginner-friendly way to introduce game development and transition into professional-level programming, without the complexity of Unity.</p>
            <h3>mBot2 Robotics</h3>
            <p>A hands-on way to learn coding! This robot includes fun sensors and can be programmed using both drag-and-drop (Scratch-style) and Python.</p>

            <p>I love coding and spreading the joy of code! My dad taught me when I was 9, and I have been professionally programming since 2017. I started out with e-commerce website development, then transitioned into mobile app engineering, and now I'm looking for my next coding adventure!</p>

            <p>I have experience teaching code at 2 different coding schools for kids. I've taught with a child-led approach and following a lesson plan. I like doing a mix of both. I've also successfully taught some of my friends how to code.</p>

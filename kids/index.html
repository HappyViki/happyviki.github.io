        <h2>Who is Veronica Eulenberg?</h2>
        <p>I love coding and spreading the joy of code! My dad taught me when I was 9, and I have been professionally programming since 2017. I started out with WordPress Development, then transitioned into React App Development, and now I'm looking for my next coding adventure!</p>

        <p>I have experience teaching code at 2 different coding schools for kids. I've taught with a child-led approach and following a lesson plan. I like doing a mix of both. I've also successfully taught some of my friends how to code.</p>

        <h2>About Lessons</h2>
        <p>I'm using the project-based approach to help kids see their programming results right away and stay interested in it. My theory is that if the project contains a subject that the kid enjoys, then it'll be easier for them to continue being interested in learning more.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Scratch is drag-n-drop, so it's easy to see results right away.</li>
            <li>Python is easier to read, so I use it as an introductory typing language.</li>
            <li>JavaScript can be programmed right in the browser, so I use it to show how to interact with the web.</li>
            <li>mBot2 is a robot that I bought with lots of fun sensors that can be programmed with drag-n-drop or Python. I'm excited to teach robotics with it :)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>When? Preferably in the morning on weekdays. Other times/days may work, let me know!</p>
        <p>Where? Anywhere near Knoxville TN should be okay. Talk with me about logistics.</p>
        <p>Cost? At the moment it's $15/hr for kids, though it may change in the future.</p>

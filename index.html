                        <h3>Skills</h3>
                        <p>HTML • CSS • JavaScript • jQuery • ReactJS • NodeJS • PHP • MySQL • WordPress • RegEx</p>

                        <h3>Short Version</h3>
                        <p>I'm a software developer with experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, PHP, MySQL, WordPress, and more. I started in 2017 as a WordPress developer and quickly became skilled in customizing themes, solving tricky CSS and JavaScript issues, and building full-stack solutions.</p>
                        <p>I later transitioned into React development, contributing to apps at JustUtahCoders, MX Technologies, and LifeOmic, where I also supported customer service tools and improved UI/UX. I've worked in data annotation for AI, earned a Security+ certification, and now teach coding and robotics to kids while continuing to consult on web projects and troubleshoot WordPress with code.</p>

                        <h3>Long Version</h3>
                        <p>My dad introduced me to the basics of programming and web development. From there, I became a self-taught developer, expanding my skills through Google searches, Stack Overflow discussions, FreeCodeCamp coursework, W3Schools resources, and guidance from mentors in Utah. I earned a CompTIA Security+ certification through 801 Labs and received software quality assurance training (SQA) from Portnov Computer School.</p>

                        <p>I launched my career in 2017 as a WordPress Developer, customizing websites and modifying plugins with code. During this time, I gained expert-level proficiency in CSS and JavaScript, making me highly effective at troubleshooting web development issues. I also configured servers and provided PHP/MySQL solutions, becoming a well-seasoned full-stack developer.</p>
                            
                        <p>In 2019, I transitioned into React development as an intern at JustUtahCoders, where I helped automate form-filling for record expungement. The following year, I further honed my React skills at MX Technologies.</p>

                        <p>In 2021, I worked at LifeOmic, splitting my time between Zendesk support and developing a React app to streamline customer service. I also contributed to UI/UX improvements based on customer feedback. Later that year, I explored data annotation at Moveworks, where I enjoyed collaborating on language semantics for machine learning models.</p>
                            
                        <p>In 2024, I began teaching programming at iCode, where I have a blast helping students explore drag-and-drop programming, .NET/C# app development, and robotics!</p>

                        <p>Currently, I continue to teach coding to kids, consult on web development, and resolve WordPress issues with code.</p>

                                    <li>Created Zendesk macros to efficiently handle common questions, and for more complex issues, sent concise, bullet-pointed emails to minimize back-and-forth and speed up resolution.</li>
                                    <li>Participated in weekly UI/UX collaboration meetings, bringing insights from my development background and incorporating customer feedback into design decisions.</li>
                                    <li>Built a customer support app that consolidated information from three separate tools, streamlining the support process and saving time for agents.</li>

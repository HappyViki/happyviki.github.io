                        <h3>Education</h3>
                        <p>My dad introduced me to the basics of programming and web development. From there, I became a self-taught developer, expanding my skills through Google searches, Stack Overflow discussions, FreeCodeCamp coursework, W3Schools resources, and guidance from mentors in Utah. I earned a CompTIA Security+ certification through 801 Labs and received software quality assurance training (SQA) from Portnov Computer School.</p>

                        <h3>First Dev Role</h3>
                        <p>I launched my career in 2017 as a WordPress Developer, customizing websites and modifying plugins with code. During this time, I gained expert-level proficiency in CSS and JavaScript, making me highly effective at troubleshooting web development issues. I also configured servers and provided PHP/MySQL solutions, becoming a well-seasoned full-stack developer.</p>
                            
                        <h3>Other Tech Roles</h3>
                        <p>In 2019, I transitioned into React development as an intern at JustUtahCoders, where I helped automate form-filling for record expungement. The following year, I further honed my React skills at MX Technologies.</p>

                        <p>In 2021, I worked at LifeOmic, splitting my time between Zendesk technical customer support and developing a React app to streamline customer service. I also contributed to UI/UX design improvements based on customer feedback. Later that year, I explored data annotation at Moveworks, where I enjoyed collaborating on language semantics for machine learning models.</p>

                        <h3>Current Work</h3>
                        <p>In 2024, I began teaching programming at iCode North Dallas, where I introduced students to drag-and-drop coding, .NET/C# app development, and robotics. I discovered a passion for making programming fun and accessible to kids.</p>

                        <p>In 2025, I expanded my business and leadership skills by learning more about marketing, client outreach, and project management. I now split my time between two roles I love: as the Education Director at iCode Knoxville, I teach coding and support the growth of the program; and as a freelancer, I specialize in fixing and customizing WordPress and React-based websites using CSS, JavaScript, and other front-end technologies.</p>

                            <p>One of my missions in life is instilling the love of programming in people of all ages. I believe it's easy to get started. Many beginner courses tend to be overwhelming. I like to be simple.</p>
